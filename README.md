# Solarized for IDLE

## Precision colors for machines and people - **Now with more IDLEness!**

---

### Solarized

Solarized was created by [Ethan Schoonover][ES] and you can find out more
about the design work that went into it on his [project page][ES-solarized]. If
you would like to use Solarized in editors other than IDLE or on your terminal,
Ethan hosts the [main repository][SolarizedRepo] which combines all the available
ports in one place.

### Solarized for IDLE

Solarized was initially ported for IDLE by [Matthew Cantelon][MC] and can be
found at <https://github.com/mattcan/solarized-idle>.
